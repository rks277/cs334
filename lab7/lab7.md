We had some issues at first with getting the stepper motor to work. 

We used the wiring diagram here: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-stepper-motor-28byj-48-uln2003/

At first we had forgotten to plug the stepper motor into power. After we did this, it seemed that my motor didn't work, so we used Peter's instead, and then the motor began to rotate as expected. 

We then began working on the servo motor. 

We believe that the micro usb cable became unplugged, so we had to plug it back in.
